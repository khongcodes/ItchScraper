use array and array navigation for menus, all Category menus are the same

Nesting menus - 

Top > Category > Sort Method > listed objects
nested arrays?

level 1 of menus (at Top, show Categories) ["Games","Tools","Game assets","Comics","Books","Physical games","Soundtracks","Game mods","Everything else"]
level 2 of menus (at Category, show Sorts) ["Popular","New & Popular","Top sellers","Top rated","Most Recent"]
level 3 of menus (at Sort Method, show listed objects) create and list array of objects, 10 at a time?

Don't forget to implement back!!!

not sure if it would be less resource intensive to make an object for ev
